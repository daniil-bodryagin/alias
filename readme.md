# Alias Game

This game was made for practicing English. When you get a new word, you must explain it in English. Other players can guess it in either English or Russian. The point is to keep practicing speaking and forming sentences. The word set was taken from the Oxford 3000 and 5000 (American English) and filtered to include nouns only.
